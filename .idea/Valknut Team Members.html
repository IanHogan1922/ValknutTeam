        Agreements:

        We will meet in person right after class to discuss what is needed and what we need to do. We are looking to do the meeting at least once a week but can do more if needed.

        We are also wanting to meet via discord during the week. We want to use discord to discuss, collaborate, and pair program. We find discord to be a good middle ground because we are able to meet out of class and talk with one other when problems or concerns may arise and we can fix them in a timely manner.

        Regarding disagreements we will keep this as more of a democracy style. We will try and talk it out and let each other know what our ideas are and how we can improve or scrap ideas. We are encouraging one other to bring up issues earlier rather than later.
